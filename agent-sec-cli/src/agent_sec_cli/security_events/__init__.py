"""security_events — fire-and-forget dual-write security event logging (JSONL + SQLite).

Public API
----------
- ``log_event(event)``        — append a ``SecurityEvent`` to both JSONL and SQLite
- ``get_writer()``            — obtain the singleton JSONL ``SecurityEventWriter``
- ``get_sqlite_writer()``     — obtain the singleton ``SqliteEventWriter``
- ``get_reader()``            — obtain the singleton ``SqliteEventReader``
- ``SecurityEvent``           — the canonical event dataclass
